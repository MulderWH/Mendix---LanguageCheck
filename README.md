# Check Language

## For expert users only and only while Mendix can't switch languages for anonymous users

After Mendix 6.7, switching languages from the Server-side no longer work, since the locale is now stored on the client-side.

## Usage

Install a static widget with prefered language on the main layout of your landing page, or user conditional visibile containers with the languages you prefer. This allows you to switch languages during run-time. It's fun to [watch]():

This widget might disappear later when Mendix gives us a mechanism to switch languages client-side.
